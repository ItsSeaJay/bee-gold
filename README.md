# Honey for CodeIgniter
Utility Scripts for the CodeIgniter PHP Framework

## About
I have fallen head-over-heels in love with CodeIgniter.
It's a powerful PHP framework that allows me to write clean, efficient code
without taking up a lot of space. If I do have a problem with it, it would be
is how involved its setup process is. To fix this, I've written a whole host of
scripts that can perform a bunch of repetitive tasks so you don't have to.

I'm a gameplay programmer by trade, and I hope that one day this library can make
web development in CodeIgniter using a text editor being a comparable experience
